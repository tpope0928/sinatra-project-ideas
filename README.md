Claimed status convo

im thinking that when a project idea is created i can add a status to it. as a beginning param? this would give the creator first dibs to clam a project for they came up with.
and in the all project ideas page i can add the status of claimed or unclaimed next to it

That sounds great.

Drew Pope [9:22 PM]
would i have to add status as a sql table?

Jennifer Pazos [9:23 PM]
Not as a table. Just an attribute

Drew Pope [9:23 PM]
ah ok

Jennifer Pazos [9:24 PM]
You could even use a conditional in your view to determine if you need to show if it's claimed
